You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

So an input of A3 should place an X at the position
['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['X', '⬜️', '⬜️']
